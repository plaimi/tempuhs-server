=====================

Rubbishes a row. Pass in the name of the table in singular form + the ID of
the row you want to delete.

N.B. /purge does a *hard delete*. This means it will *delete* the row from the
database. A purge is only possible on a rubbished resource.

Examples
--------
Rubbish the timespan with ID 1:
/timespans/timespan=1

Rubbish the role with ID 2:
/roles/role=2

Rubbishing other things and IDs is left as an exercise for the frontend
engineer...

*Really* delete the timespan with ID 1:
/timespans/purge?timespan=1

Something something exercise for the frontend engineer.
